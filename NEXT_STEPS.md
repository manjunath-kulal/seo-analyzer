Subject: Built an SEO Analyzer Inspired by Writesonic

Hi [Name],

I'm a full-stack developer fascinated by Writesonic's approach to AI-powered content optimization. To better understand the domain, I built a mini SEO analyzer with similar capabilities.

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/[yourusername]/writesonic-seo-analyzer
🌐 Live Demo: [Add if you deploy it]

Key features:
✓ Readability analysis (Flesch Reading Ease)
✓ Keyword extraction & density tracking
✓ Plagiarism detection using N-grams
✓ Google SERP preview with CTR prediction
✓ AI-powered improvement suggestions

Built with FastAPI (Python) + Next.js 14 + TypeScript.

I'd love to hear your thoughts or discuss how tools like this could enhance content optimization workflows.

Best regards,
